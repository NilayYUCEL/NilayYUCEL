<h3 align="left">Data Scientist | Data Analyst</h3>
Hello, I‚Äôm Nilay. I am a computer engineer specializing in data science/ data analysis. With each passing day, I continue to enhance my expertise and work toward advancing in this field. In 2022, I graduated from the Computer Engineering Department at Dokuz Eyl√ºl University. Before completing my studies, I began my journey in data science/ data analysis through internships and part-time roles.

After graduation, I joined IBTech, the primary software company of QNB Finansbank, as a Data Analyst. During my time there, I worked with large and complex datasets, contributing to significant projects in areas such as reporting, data analysis, and machine learning etc.. This role provided me with significant experience in SQL, helping me to build deep expertise in the field and confidently apply it to complex data problems.

In addition to my professional experience, I have developed independent projects in data science, machine learning, and data visualization etc.. My collaborative approach, problem-solving abilities, and strong planning skills enable me to contribute effectively to any team or project. I believe that my sense of responsibility and attention to detail are key strengths that set me apart in my field.

If you‚Äôre seeking a skilled and dedicated data analyst for your projects, I‚Äôd be delighted to connect and explore how we can work together!
